## Analysis
This project analyzes the Stack Overflow 2017 survey data using Python programming language. Below, you can find information about how to use the project and what each code snippet does.

#### Project
This project aims to analyze the demographic information, work habits, and preferences of developers who participated in the Stack Overflow 2017 survey. 
The goal is to extract interesting insights from the survey data and understand the overall trends in the developer community.

#### Motivation
Inspired by the 2017 Stack Overflow survey, our project embarks on a data-driven journey to uncover the intricate interplay between programming languages and job-seeking dynamics across different countries. By delving into the multifaceted landscape of employment and skills, we aspire to provide a comprehensive understanding of how developers' expertise, job-seeking status, and geographic location intersect. This endeavor ignites our passion, as it promises to shed light on the global job market and empower both job seekers and employers with invaluable insights for making informed decisions.

#### Installation
Clone this project to your computer: git clone https://github.com/Caner-Kut/my-data-science-project.git
Install the required Python packages by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
#### Usage

## Project Process (Data Preparation - Modelling - Visualization)

The tech industry is constantly evolving, and programming languages play a crucial role in its development. In this blog post, we will analyze the usage of programming languages and the job-seeking trends in the tech industry using a dataset from a survey conducted among professionals. By exploring this data, we aim to gain insights into the most popular programming languages and the job-seeking behavior of professional developers.



# We will try to answer this kind of questions in analysis,you will find code in python file.Here is the some analysis question that helps us below.

'How did you handle missing values in your dataset, and why is it important in data analysis?

#Can you explain the significance of the 'Professional,' 'Country,' and 'JobSeekingStatus' columns in your analysis? What role do these variables play in your research?

#You've created a bar chart to visualize professional status. Could you elaborate on the insights you gained from this chart?

#In your analysis of job-seeking professionals, what criteria did you use to define "Professional developer," and why is this distinction relevant?

#You've compared the proportions of job-seeking professionals by country. Were there any unexpected findings or trends that stood out to you?

#The code calculates the most frequently mentioned programming languages. How might this information be valuable to employers or aspiring developers?

#In the analysis of salary data, you used the 'Salary' and 'HaveWorkedLanguage' columns. Could you discuss how these two variables are related and why they are essential in your analysis?

#What can we infer from the bar charts showing maximum and average salaries by programming language? Were there any languages that surprised you with their earnings?

#The code also explores the relationship between company size and programming language usage. Why is this analysis relevant, and what does it reveal about the job market?

#In your analysis of different company sizes (e.g., 20-99 employees, 100-499 employees), did you identify specific programming languages that are particularly popular among professionals in certain-sized companies?

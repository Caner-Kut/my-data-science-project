## Stack Overflow 2017 Survey Analysis
This project analyzes the Stack Overflow 2017 survey data using Python programming language. Below, you can find information about how to use the project and what each code snippet does.

#### About the Project
This project aims to analyze the demographic information, work habits, and preferences of developers who participated in the Stack Overflow 2017 survey. 
The goal is to extract interesting insights from the survey data and understand the overall trends in the developer community.

#### Motivation
Inspired by the 2017 Stack Overflow survey, our project embarks on a data-driven journey to uncover the intricate interplay between programming languages and job-seeking dynamics across different countries. By delving into the multifaceted landscape of employment and skills, we aspire to provide a comprehensive understanding of how developers' expertise, job-seeking status, and geographic location intersect. This endeavor ignites our passion, as it promises to shed light on the global job market and empower both job seekers and employers with invaluable insights for making informed decisions.

## Project Process (Data Preparation - Modelling - Visualization)

The tech industry is constantly evolving, and programming languages play a crucial role in its development. In this blog post, we will analyze the usage of programming languages and the job-seeking trends in the tech industry using a dataset from a survey conducted among professionals. By exploring this data, we aim to gain insights into the most popular programming languages and the job-seeking behavior of professional developers.
